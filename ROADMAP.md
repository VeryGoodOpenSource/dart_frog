# Roadmap 🗺️

In the interest of transparency, we want to share high-level details of our roadmap, so that others can see our priorities and make plans based off the work we are doing.

## Areas of Focus 💡

### Production Readiness ⚙️

#### Bugs/Quality 🐛

- [X] Resolve internal dynamic routing issue with `package:shelf_router`
- [X] Abstract `package:shelf` fully from the end-user so that `shelf` implementation details don't leak from the DartFrog public API
  - [X] Also, simplify interfaces whereever possible to avoid having multiple ways to achieve the same thing and to keep the API surface as small as possible
