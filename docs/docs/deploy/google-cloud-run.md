# Google Cloud Run ‚òÅÔ∏è

[Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) is a service in the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) that allows you to deploy highly scalable containerized applications using your favorite language on a fully managed serverless platform. You can use Cloud Run to serve requests from your Dart Frog API to the internet. This will provide:

- Fully managed autoscaling to handle any number of requests
- Only pay for the computing resources you use, and pay nothing when your service isn't being used
- Automatic logging in [Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging)

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, if you don't already have these, you'll need to create:

- A [free Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en)
- A [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)
- A [billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account#create_a_new_billing_account) connected to your GCP project

:::caution
While the Google Cloud Platform has a free tier that should cover testing projects, you can incur costs when running this quickstart through Cloud Run, Cloud Build, or Artifact Registry. For more details, see the [Google Cloud Price List](https://cloud.google.com/pricing/list).
:::

Additionally, you'll need the [`gcloud` command line interface (CLI)](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed on your computer.

Finally, you'll want to log in to `gcloud` by running:

```bash
gcloud auth login
```

## Deploying

1. Build your API for production use by running:

```bash
dart_frog build
```

This will create a `/build` directory with all the files needed to deploy your API.

2. Deploy your API to Cloud Run by running:

```bash
gcloud run deploy [SERVICE_NAME] \
  --source build \
  --project=[PROJECT_ID] \
  --region=[REGION] \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

- `[SERVICE_NAME]`: The name of the Cloud Run service you want to create/update
- `[PROJECT_ID]`: The ID of the Google Cloud project
- `[REGION]`: The GCP region you wish to deploy to (ex: us-central1)

:::caution
There is an ongoing [issue](https://github.com/google/gvisor/issues/7331) that is preventing Dart Unix Sockets from working correctly in the gen1 version of the [Cloud Run execution environment](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/about-execution-environments). In that case, it is recommended to deploy to gen2 by adding `--execution-environment=gen2`.
:::

Running this command will do three things:

- Upload the code in the `/build` directory
- Build the Docker image in [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build) and upload it to [Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry)
- Deploy the image to the specified Cloud Run service

3. Congratulations! üéâ You have successfully built and deployed your API to Cloud Run. You can now access your API at the Service URL that is printed in the last line of output.

:::note
If you have not already enabled the necessary Google Cloud APIs to deploy your API, `gcloud` can enable them for you. Just select `Y` when prompted.
:::

:::tip
You can save the project ID and region to `gcloud` so you don't have to specify them each time you deploy.

```bash
gcloud config set core/project [PROJECT_ID]
gcloud config set run/region [REGION]
```

:::

Example:

```bash
$ gcloud run deploy hello  --source build --allow-unauthenticated
