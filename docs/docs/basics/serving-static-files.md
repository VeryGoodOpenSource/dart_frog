# Serving Static Files üìÅ

Dart Frog supports serving static files including images, text, json, html, and more.

## Overview üöÄ

To serve static files, place the files within the `public` directory at the root of the project.

For example, if you create a file in `public/hello.txt` which contains the following:

```
Hello World!
```

The contents of the file will be available at [http://localhost:8080/hello.txt](http://localhost:8080/hello.txt).

The `public` directory can also contain static files within subdirectories. For example, if you create an image in `public/images/unicorn.png`, the contents of the file will be available at [http://localhost:8080/images/unicorn.png](http://localhost:8080/images/unicorn.png).

When running a development server, static files can be added, removed, and modified without needing to restart the server thanks to hot reload ‚ö°Ô∏è.

:::note
Static file support requires `dart_frog ^0.0.2-dev.7` and `dart_frog_cli ^0.0.1-dev.8`
:::

:::note
The `/public` folder must be at the root of the project and cannot be renamed. This is the only directory used to serve static files.
:::

:::note
In production, only files that are in the `/public` directory at build time will be served.
:::

:::caution
Be sure not to have a static file with the same name as a file in the `/routes` directory as this will result in a conflict.

## Using a Custom Directory ‚ú®

Even though Dart Frog uses the `public` directory for serving static files by default, you can also specify a custom directory by creating a [custom entrypoint](/docs/advanced/custom_entrypoint).

Create a `main.dart` at the root of your project with the following contents:

```dart
import 'dart:io';

import 'package:dart_frog/dart_frog.dart';

Future<HttpServer> run(Handler handler, InternetAddress ip, int port) {
  const customStaticFilePath = 'api/static';
  final cascade = Cascade()
      .add(createStaticFileHandler(path: customStaticFilePath))
      .add(handler);
  return serve(cascade.handler, ip, port);
}
```

In the above example, we're using `api/static` as our static file directory but you can specify a path to any directory for Dart Frog to use.
