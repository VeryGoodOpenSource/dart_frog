#  Authentication with JWT 🪪 

:::info
**Difficulty**: 🟠 Intermediate<br/>
**Length**: 30 minutes

Before getting started, [read the Dart Frog prerequisites](/docs/overview#prerequisites) to make sure your development environment is ready.
:::

## Overview

In this tutorial, we're going to build an app that exposes endpoints accessible only to users
that have been authenticated.

When we're done, we should be able to authenticate with a user credentials, and access the
protected routes.

Like mentioned in the [Dart Frog Authentication documentation](https://dartfrog.vgv.dev/docs/advanced/authentication),
there are many ways of implementing authentication in a backend, for this tutorial we will use a
hardcoded, in memory, database of users and [Json Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) (or for short JWTs)
for the user's authentication token.

## Creating a new app

To create a new Dart Frog app, open your terminal, change to the directory where you'd like to create the app, and run the following command:

```bash
dart_frog create authenticated_app
```

You should see an output similar to:

```
✓ Creating authenticated_app (0.1s)
✓ Installing dependencies (1.7s)

Created authenticated_app at ./authenticated_app.

Get started by typing:

cd ./authenticated_app
dart_frog dev
```

## Running the development server

You should now have a directory called `authenticated_app`. Let's change directories into the newly created project:

```bash
cd authenticated_app
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
authenticated_app dev
```

This will start the development server on port `8080`:

```
✓ Running on http://localhost:8080 (1.3s)
The Dart VM service is listening on http://127.0.0.1:8181/YKEF_nbwOpM=/
The Dart DevTools debugger and profiler is available at: http://127.0.0.1:8181/YKEF_nbwOpM=/devtools/#/?uri=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A8181%2FYKEF_nbwOpM%3D%2Fws
[hotreload] Hot reload is enabled.
```

Make sure it's working by opening [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser or via `cURL`:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:8080
```

If everything succeeded, you should see `Welcome to Dart Frog!`.

## The hardcode domain code

To keep the tutorial simple and focused on authentication, our database of users will be hardcoded and
the `User` model will be simple, containing just an id and a name.

For next steps, use the code below to create the domain classes.

```dart
// lib/user.dart
class User {
  const User({
    required this.id,
    required this.name,
    required this.password,
  });

  final String id;
  final String name;
  final String password;
}

// lib/authenticator.dart
import 'package:authenticated_app/user.dart';

class Authenticator {
  static const _users = {
    'john': User(
      id: '1',
      name: 'John',
      password: '123',
    ),
    'jack': User(
      id: '2',
      name: 'Jack',
      password: '321',
    ),
  };

  static const _passwords = {
    // ⚠️ Never store user's password in plain text, these values are in plain text
    // just for the sake of the tutorial.
    'john': '123',
    'jack': '321',
  };

  User? findByUsernameAndPassword({
    required String username,
    required String password,
  }) {
    final user = _users[username];

    if (user != null && _passwords[username] == password) {
      return user;
    }

    return null;
  }
}

```

We also need to provide our `Authenticator` to our routes. Since it will be used by
several routes like a sign in and all the routes that are authenticated, it makes sense to
provide it to all routes.

In order to do so, we can use [Dart frog's dependecy injection](https://dartfrog.vgv.dev/docs/basics/dependency-injection)
and create a middleware in the root of our `routes` folder with the following code:

```dart
import 'package:authenticated_app/authenticator.dart';
import 'package:dart_frog/dart_frog.dart';

Handler middleware(Handler handler) {
  return handler.use(
    provider<Authenticator>(
      (_) => Authenticator(),
    ),
  );
}
```

## Writing a Sign In route

Now that we have all the domain code necessary to authenticate users given an username and a password.

So let's now create a route where we can use to authenticate users. In the routes folder, create the file below:

```dart
```

## REPLACE FROM DOWN HERE
## Creating the WebSocket Route

Now that we have a running application, let's start by creating a new `ws` route at `routes/ws.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:dart_frog/dart_frog.dart';

Response onRequest(RequestContext context) {
  return Response(body: 'You have requested /ws');
}
```

We can also delete the root endpoint at `routes/index.dart` since we won't be needing it for this example.

:::tip

:::

Save the changes and hot reload should kick in ⚡️

```
[hotreload] - Application reloaded.
```

Now if we visit [http://localhost:8080/ws](http://localhost:8080/ws) in the browser or via `cURL`:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:8080/ws
```

We should see our new response:

```
You have requested /ws
```

## Adding a WebSocket Handler

Next, we need to upgrade our route handler to handle WebSocket connections. To do this we'll use the [dart_frog_web_socket](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_frog_web_socket) package.

Add the `dart_frog_web_socket` dependency:

```
dart pub add dart_frog_web_socket
```

Now, let's update our route handler at `routes/ws.dart` to use the provided `webSocketHandler` from `dart_frog_web_socket`:

```dart
import 'package:dart_frog/dart_frog.dart';
import 'package:dart_frog_web_socket/dart_frog_web_socket.dart';

Future<Response> onRequest(RequestContext context) async {
  final handler = webSocketHandler(
    (channel, protocol) {
      // A new client has connected to our server.
      print('connected');

      // Send a message to the client.
      channel.sink.add('hello from the server');

      // Listen for messages from the client.
      channel.stream.listen(
        print,
        // The client has disconnected.
        onDone: () => print('disconnected'),
      );
    },
  );

  return handler(context);
}
```

:::info
For more information, refer to the [WebSocket documentation](/docs/advanced/web_socket).
:::

Save the changes and hot reload should kick in ⚡️

Now we should be able to write a simple script to test the WebSocket connection.

## Establishing a WebSocket Connection

Create a new directory called `example` at the project root and create a `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
name: example
publish_to: none

environment:
  sdk: '>=3.0.0 <4.0.0'

dependencies:
  web_socket_channel: ^2.4.0
```

Next, install the dependencies:

```sh
dart pub get
```

Now, create a `main.dart` with the following contents:

```dart
import 'package:web_socket_channel/web_socket_channel.dart';

void main() {
  // Connect to the remote WebSocket endpoint.
  final uri = Uri.parse('ws://localhost:8080/ws');
  final channel = WebSocketChannel.connect(uri);

  // Listen to messages from the server.
  channel.stream.listen(print);

  // Send a message to the server.
  channel.sink.add('hello from the client');

  // Close the connection.
  channel.sink.close();
}
```

We're using [`package:web_socket_channel`](https://pub.dev/packages/web_socket_channel) to connect to our Dart Frog `/ws` endpoint. We can send messages to the server by calling `add` on the `WebSocketChannel` sink. We can listen to incoming messages by subscribing to the `WebSocketChannel` stream.

With the Dart Frog server still running, open a separate terminal, and run the example script:

```bash
dart example/main.dart
```

We should see the following output on the client:

```
hello from the server
```

On the server we should see the following output:

```
connected
hello from the client
disconnected
```

Awesome! We've configured a WebSocket handler and established a connection to our server 🎉

## Managing the Counter State

Now that we've configured the WebSocket handler, we're going to shift gears and work on creating a component that will manage the state of the counter.

In this example, we're going to use a cubit from the [Bloc Library](https://bloclibrary.dev) to manage the state of our counter because it provides a reactive API which allows us to stream state changes and query the current state at any given point in time. We're going to use [package:broadcast_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/broadcast_bloc) which allows blocs or cubits to broadcast their state changes to any subscribed stream channels — this will come in handy later on.

Let's add the `broadcast_bloc` dependency:

```
dart pub add broadcast_bloc
```

Then, create a cubit in `lib/counter/cubit/counter_cubit.dart`.

```dart
import 'package:broadcast_bloc/broadcast_bloc.dart';

class CounterCubit extends BroadcastCubit<int> {
  // Create an instance with an initial state of 0.
  CounterCubit() : super(0);

  // Increment the current state.
  void increment() => emit(state + 1);

  // Decrement the current state.
  void decrement() => emit(state - 1);
}
```

In order to access the cubit from our route handler, we'll create a `provider` in `lib/counter/middleware/counter_provider.dart`.

```dart
import 'package:dart_frog/dart_frog.dart';
import 'package:web_socket_counter/counter/counter.dart';

final _counter = CounterCubit();

// Provide the counter instance via `RequestContext`.
final counterProvider = provider<CounterCubit>((_) => _counter);
```

:::info
For more information, refer to the [dependency injection documentation](/docs/basics/dependency-injection).
:::

Let's also create a barrel file which exports all `counter` components in `lib/counter/counter.dart`:

```dart
export 'cubit/counter_cubit.dart';
export 'middleware/counter_provider.dart';
```

## Providing the Counter

We need to use the `counterProvider` in order to have access to it in nested. Create a global piece of middleware (`routes/_middleware.dart`):

```dart
import 'package:dart_frog/dart_frog.dart';
import 'package:web_socket_counter/counter/counter.dart';

Handler middleware(Handler handler) => handler.use(counterProvider);
```

:::info

:::

## Using the Counter

We can access the `CounterCubit` instance from our WebSocket handler via `context.read<CounterCubit>()`.

```dart
import 'package:dart_frog/dart_frog.dart';
import 'package:dart_frog_web_socket/dart_frog_web_socket.dart';
import 'package:web_socket_counter/counter/counter.dart';

Future<Response> onRequest(RequestContext context) async {
  final handler = webSocketHandler(
    (channel, protocol) {
      // A new client has connected to our server.
      // Subscribe the new client to receive notifications
      // whenever the cubit state changes.
      final cubit = context.read<CounterCubit>()..subscribe(channel);

      // Send the current count to the new client.
      channel.sink.add('${cubit.state}');

      // Listen for messages from the client.
      channel.stream.listen(
        (event) {
          switch (event) {
            // Handle an increment message.
            case '__increment__':
              cubit.increment();
              break;
            // Handle a decrement message.
            case '__decrement__':
              cubit.decrement();
              break;
            // Ignore any other messages.
            default:
              break;
          }
        },
        // The client has disconnected.
        // Unsubscribe the channel.
        onDone: () => cubit.unsubscribe(channel),
      );
    },
  );

  return handler(context);
}
```

First, we subscribe the newly connected client to the `CounterCubit` in order to receive updates whenever the cubit state changes.

Next, we send the current count to the new client via `cubit.state`.

When the client sends a new message, we invoke the `increment`/`decrement` method on the cubit based on the message.

Finally, we unsubscribe the channel when the client disconnects.

:::info
The `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` APIs are exposed by the `BroadcastCubit` super class from `package:broadcast_bloc`.
:::

Be sure to save all the changes and hot reload should kick in ⚡️

```
[hotreload] - Application reloaded.
```

Now we can update our example script in `example/main.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:web_socket_channel/web_socket_channel.dart';

void main() async {
  final channel = WebSocketChannel.connect(Uri.parse('ws://localhost:8080/ws'));
  channel.stream.listen(print);

  channel.sink.add('__increment__');
  channel.sink.add('__decrement__');

  channel.sink.close();
}
```

Finally, let's run the script:

```
dart example/main.dart
```

We should see the following output:

```
0
1
0
```

:::note
If you restart the server, the count will always be reset to 0 because it is only maintained in memory.
