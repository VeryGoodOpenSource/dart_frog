# ðŸ§° Daemon

Dart Frog daemon is a standing process that, during its lifetime, will be used by first and
third-party tools to manage, build, and diagnose Dart Frog projects.

By design, the daemon is able to manage multiple projects simultaneously; it can also run multiple
application instances of the same project if necessary.

To start using it, install the Dart Frog CLI and run the `dart_frog daemon` command. Once running, communicating with it can be done via [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) over stdin/stdout to receive and send messages.

There are three types of messages:

- **Request**: A request is a message sent by a client to the daemon. The daemon will process the
  request and send a response back to the client. A request is essentially a method invocation.
- **Response**: A response is a message sent by the daemon to a client in response to a request.
- **Event**: An event is a message sent by the daemon to a client. The daemon will send an event to
  a client when something happens, for example, when a running dev server stops.

Every request should be met with a response as soon as possible so the caller can work with
timeouts. The daemon will send events to the client as they happen.

---

#### Usage example

```sh
$ dart_frog daemon

// ready event sent via stdout
[{"event":"daemon.ready","params":{"version":"0.0.1","processId":75941}}]

// request inserted via stdin
[{"method": "daemon.requestVersion", "id": "12"}]

// response sent via stdout
[{"id":"12","result":{"version":"0.0.1"}}]
```

The `id` field on the request is used to match the request with the response. As the client sets it arbitrarily, the client is responsible for ensuring that all request ids are unique.

:::warning
The requests should be strictly in the format `[{...}]`. Therefore, sending a request with any of these formats: `[{...},]`, `[{...}, {...}]` or `[{...}]\n[{...}]` is currently not accepted.

# Domains

To organize the accepted requests and its parameters as well as events, there are "domains." A
domain is a group of related requests and events.

The domains are:

# Logging events

Some operations (eg. starting a dev server) will generate logs. These logs are sent to the client
via logging events. These events are identified by the "logger" prefix on its name followed by its
severity. Its domain is always associated with the operation that generated the log.

For example, this is logger event generate bhy the `dev_server.start` operation
(the content was formatted to improve readability):

```json
[
  {
    "event": "dev_server.loggerInfo",
    "params": {
      "applicationId": "cfd5d56a-b855-49a7-9153-a035b1ba1bc4",
      "requestId": "2",
      "workingDirectory": "/path/to/project",
      "message": "The Dart VM service is listening on http://127.0.0.1:8091/fWMHu3sTnYk=/"
    }
  }
]
```

In this example, it is a logger event with the `info` severity. The `params` field contains the
metadata associated with the event. In this case, the `applicationId` and `requestId` fields
can be used to identify the operation that generated the log.

The available severities are:

| level    | identification                                        |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| debug    | `loggerDetail`                                        |
| info     | `loggerInfo` <br/> `loggerSuccess`<br/> `loggerWrite` |
| warn     | `loggerWarning`                                       |
| error    | `loggerError`                                         |
| critical | `loggerAlert`                                         |

---

Associated with logging, there is also the progress loggings. These are used to signal the
progress of a long-running operation. For example, when generating server code. These events
are identified by the "progress" prefix on its name. Its domain is always associated with the
operation that generated the log. The identifiers are associated not with severity but with
its progress. The available identifiers are:

| identifier         | details                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `progressStart`    | Identifies the start of the progress. Its params include `progressId` which can be used to track further events associated with this operation. |
| `progressUpdate`   | Identifies an update on the progress.                                                                                                           |
| `progressCancel`   | Progress was cancelled. Ends the progress.                                                                                                      |
| `progressFail`     | Progress has failed. Ends the progress.                                                                                                         |
| `progressComplete` | Progress has completed. Ends the progress.                                                                                                      |
