# ðŸ§° Daemon

Dart frog daemon is a standing process that, during its lifetime, will be used by first and
third-party tools to manage, build, and diagnose dart frog projects.

By design, a daemon is able to manage multiple projects simultaneously. The daemon can run multiple
application instances of the same project if necessary.

The daemon can be started by running the `dart_frog daemon` command. The daemon
uses [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) over stdin/stdout to receive and send messages.

The messages can be sorted in three types:

- **Request**: A request is a message sent by a client to the daemon. The daemon will process the
  request and send a response back to the client. A request is essentially a method invocation.
- **Response**: A response is a message sent by the daemon to a client in response to a request.
- **Event**: An event is a message sent by the daemon to a client. The daemon will send an event to
  a client when something happens, for example, when a running dev server stops.

Every request should be met with a response as soon as possible so the caller can work with
timeouts. The daemon will send events to the client as they happen.

---

#### Usage example

```json
$ dart_frog daemon

// ready event sent via stdout
[{"event":"daemon.ready","params":{"version":"0.0.1","processId":75941}}]

// request inserted via stdin
[{"method": "daemon.requestVersion", "id": "12"}]

// response sent via stdout
[{"id":"12","result":{"version":"0.0.1"}}]

```

The `id` field on the request is used to match the request with the response. As the client sets it arbitrarily, the client is responsible for ensuring that the id is unique.

---

To organize the accepted requests and its parameters as well as events, there are "domains." A
domain is a group of related requests and events.

The domains are:
